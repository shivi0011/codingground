     //generated on behalf of an event and this leads to wake-up of a process !!!  
     //
     //sigsuspend() blocks until an unmasked signal in the mask
     //passed to it arrives - while the sigsuspend() is blocked,
     //the signalmask used by the process is the one that is
     //passed to sigsuspend, not its original signal mask
     //when sigsuspend() wakes-up, the process starts using 
     //its original signalmask field  
     ret = sigsuspend(&set1);//this process normally blocks here

     //process will be woken up and terminated due to default action - however,

     //in this case, we are using a dummy signal handler to resume this process
     //to continue executing after sigsuspend(), when SIGTERM signal arrives !!!

     //if a handler is installed, sigsuspend() will return with
     //a -1 in ret and errno set to EINTR

     //for any system call API, system returns 0, +ve or -1 via
     //ret value - in addition, system library may also set 
     //a special library variable known as errno - this variable
    //is valid and relevant when a system call API returns -1 
    //let us say that a process is blocked in a system call API and
    //a signal handler is installed - if the signal arrives and 
    //action is taken, signal handler will execute and the system 
    //call API will return -1 as well - in addition errno of this
    //process will be set to EINTR by system library !!!

    //set to EINTR !!!
