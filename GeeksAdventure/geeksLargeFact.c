factorial(n)
1) Create an array ‘res[]’ of MAX size where MAX is number of maximum digits in output.
2) Initialize value stored in ‘res[]’ as 1 and initialize ‘res_size’ (size of ‘res[]’) as 1.
3) Do following for all numbers from x = 2 to n.
……a) Multiply x with res[] and update res[] and res_size to store the multiplication result.

How to multiply a number ‘x’ with the number stored in res[]?
The idea is to use simple school mathematics. We one by one multiply x with every digit of res[]. The important point to note here is digits are multiplied from rightmost digit to leftmost digit. If we store digits in same order in res[], then it becomes difficult to update res[] without extra space. That is why res[] is maintained in reverse way, i.e., digits from right to left are stored.

multiply(res[], x)
1) Initialize carry as 0.
2) Do following for i = 0 to res_size – 1
….a) Find value of res[i] * x + carry. Let this value be prod.
….b) Update res[i] by storing last digit of prod in it.
….c) Update carry by storing remaining digits in carry.
3) Put all digits of carry in res[] and increase res_size by number of digits in carry.

Example to show working of multiply(res[], x)
A number 5189 is stored in res[] as following.
res[] = {9, 8, 1, 5}
x = 10

Initialize carry = 0;

i = 0, prod = res[0]*x + carry = 9*10 + 0 = 90.
res[0] = 0, carry = 9

i = 1, prod = res[1]*x + carry = 8*10 + 9 = 89
res[1] = 9, carry = 8

i = 2, prod = res[2]*x + carry = 1*10 + 8 = 18
res[2] = 8, carry = 1

i = 3, prod = res[3]*x + carry = 5*10 + 1 = 51
res[3] = 1, carry = 5

res[4] = carry = 5

res[] = {0, 9, 8, 1, 5} 

Below is C++ implementation of above algorithm.
// C++ program to compute factorial of big numbers
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// Maximum number of digits in output
#define MAX 500
 
int multiply(int x, int res[], int res_size)
 
// This function finds factorial of large numbers and prints them
void factorial(int n)
{
    int res[MAX];
 
    // Initialize result
    res[0] = 1;
    int res_size = 1;
 
    // Apply simple factorial formula n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4...*n
    for (int x=2; x<=n; x++)
        res_size = multiply(x, res, res_size);
 
    cout << "Factorial of given number is \n";
    for (int i=res_size-1; i>=0; i--)
        cout << res[i];
}
 
// This function multiplies x with the number represented by res[].
// res_size is size of res[] or number of digits in the number represented
// by res[]. This function uses simple school mathematics for multiplication.
// This function may value of res_size and returns the new value of res_size
int multiply(int x, int res[], int res_size)
{
    int carry = 0;  // Initialize carry
 
    // One by one multiply n with individual digits of res[]
    for (int i=0; i<res_size; i++)
    {
        int prod = res[i] * x + carry;
        res[i] = prod % 10;  // Store last digit of 'prod' in res[]
        carry  = prod/10;    // Put rest in carry
    }
 
    // Put carry in res and increase result size
    while (carry)
    {
        res[res_size] = carry%10;
        carry = carry/10;
        res_size++;
    }
    return res_size;
}
 
// Driver program
int main()
{
    factorial(100);
    return 0;
}
