kernel values should be unsigned 8 bit integers... uint_8 kernel = {-2, -2, 0, -2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0};
On almost every system uint8_t is just a typedef for unsigned char
It documents your intent - you will be storing small numbers, rather than a character.
The whole point is to write implementation-independent code. unsigned char is not guaranteed to be a 8-bit type. uint8_t is. 

Convolution is a common image processing technique that changes the intensities of a pixel to reflect the intensities of the surrounding pixels. A common use of convolution is to create image filters. Using convolution, you can get popular image effects like blur, sharpen, and edge detection
